This repository contains all materials related to the Python workshop series hosted by the **Solar Energy Association (SEA)** and **Engineering Service Learning (ENGRSL)** at the University of California, Merced, in the fall semester of 2021.

These workshops aim to teach the fundamentals of computer programming to participants by using Python as a first language. Workshop participants will work in groups to solve logical puzzles, design algorithms, write code, and finally apply their knowledge to program Tello quadcopter drones.
